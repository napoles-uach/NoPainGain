To ensure a dynamic and engaging submission process, we ask that all hackathon teams submit their final projects through social media (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube). 
By sharing your work with a broader audience, you’ll help to promote groundbreaking research in materials science and chemistry while inspiring others to contribute to the field.

Here are the guidelines for submitting your project:

1. Create a concise video presentation (2 minutes or less) summarizing your team’s project, highlighting its applications in materials science and chemistry, and showcasing the innovative use of LLMs.

2. Post your video to at least one of the following social media platforms: YouTube, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Ensure that your video is public and easily accessible.

3. One team member should provide a link to your post in the Slack #submissions channel. Submissions must be received by [March 30th at 9:00 AM Central Time (CT)](https://everytimezone.com/s/709a24e0)!
