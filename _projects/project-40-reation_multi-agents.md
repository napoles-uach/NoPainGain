This project is focused on enhancing the efficiency of the Suzuki reaction process through an advanced multi-agent system, incorporating large language models (LLMs) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). The innovation lies in the employment of specialized sub-agents, each with expertise in a crucial domain of the reaction: catalyst design, solvent effects, and base selection. These agents work in concert with a supervisory agent, which integrates their insights and findings. This collaborative framework aims to optimize reaction conditions iteratively, leveraging both prior knowledge and experimental data to navigate the chemical space effectively.
