Traditionally, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is performed for a specific optimization task, e.g., for optimizing a cell culture medium for a specific cell type. 
If the medium is to be optimized for a different cell type, a new, uncorrelated optimization campaign is started.
In multi-context BO (which could also be referred to as transfer learning), the information already available about the medium optimization campaign for the previous cell type is inherited into the new run.

In this project, we aim to investigate _(i)_ the multiple-context performance of BO frameworks on existing benchmarks, _(ii)_ develop new benchmarks for such tasks based on existing data, and _(iii)_ possibly also investigate different ways of incorporating prior knowledge into the model.
