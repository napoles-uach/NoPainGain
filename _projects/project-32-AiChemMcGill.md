This project focuses on developing a Bayesian optimization workflow for protein mutagenesis enhancing protein binding affinity. Using predictions generated by the model such as the one outlined in the study from from Rube et al. (Nat. Biotech., 2022), our approach aims to optimize protein mutagenesis for biologics and enzyme engineering applications. By integrating predictive models with Bayesian optimization, we seek to efficiently guide the design of high-affinity protein variants through the vast search space of potential nucleotides mutations.
