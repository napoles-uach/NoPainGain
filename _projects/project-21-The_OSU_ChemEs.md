Recent works [1,2] are increasingly turning towards active encoding of molecular feature spaces. The motivation behind active encoding is that a priori encodings may not exhibit a smooth response to an arbitrary molecular property, reducing the performance of sample-efficient optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization.    
This project will focus on the algorithms proposed in [1] and [2], applied to the benchmarking datasets with real-world noise features. Additionally, we plan to extend these algorithms to the constrained and multi-objective benchmarking datasets.
