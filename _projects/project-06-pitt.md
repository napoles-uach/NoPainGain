We will investigate the problem of transparent electromagnetic interference shielding to protect electronic circuits or devices by finding an optimal nano-structure using Bayesian optimization. We will parameterize a thin-film structure considering the material and thickness of each layer, and then optimize two objective functions with mulit-objective Bayesian optimization. In addition, we will showcase our own transfer-matrix method package for computing the propagation of electromagnetic waves as well as our Bayesian optimization package.
